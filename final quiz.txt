Using the Nencounter table from the class data:
a) How many patients had at least 1 inpatient encounter that started in 2003? answer = 1074
b) How many patients had at least 1 emergency room encounter that started in 2003? answer = 1978
c) How many patients had at least 1 visit of either type (inpatient or emergency room encounter) that started in 2003? answer = 2891
d) In patients from c) who had at least 1 visit of either type, create a variable that counts the total number encounters (of either type)-for example, a patient with one inpatient encounter and one emergency room encounter would have a total encounter count of 2. Generate a frequency table of total encounter number for this data set, and paste the (text) table into your assignment- use the SAS tip from class to make the table output text-friendly

Additional Info/hints
-you only need to use the NENCOUNTER table for this question 
-EncWID uniquely identifies encounters
-EncPatWID uniquely identifies patients
-Use EncStartDtm to identify encounters occurring in 2003
-EncVisitTypeCd identifies encounter types (EMERG/INPT)

-You will need to flatfile to end up 1 row per patient id, and decide on a strategy to count inpatient, emerg and total encounters for each patient to answer each part of the assignment. 
-There are many ways to accomplish these tasks. You could create one final dataset that can be used to answer all of a) through d), or you may wish to create different datasets/use different approaches to answer different parts. Choose an approach you are most comfortable with, and include lots of comments with your SAS code to describe what your code is doing (makes part marks easier to award and a good practice regardless).

Please submit your solutions through Github as a plain text .sas or .txt file.
